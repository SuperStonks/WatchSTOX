## Overview
### Description
Simple stock tracking app which lets you watch your favorite stocks, and browse different ones as well. 
Could potentially be used as a stock simulator in the future or an easy way of checking stocks daily without having
to search them up.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Finance / Simulation
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile and would probably be useful on PC as
well depending if we add a simulation aspect. The mobile version would definitely be more handy as
it would be used constantly to check stocks rather than turning on a PC to check stocks.
- **Story:** Stores your favorite stocks on a watch list and let's you customise which ones are worth
putting on your home tab. 
- **Market:** Although there are many similar apps, this is straight to the point and it's available to
all ages.
- **Habit:** This app would be used daily as stocks change day by day and it's also up to the user's 
discretion on how often they want to check stock prices.
- **Scope:** First we will start on implementing stock watches/favorites and stock searching. Maybe then
we can add ways to show and analyze the stock market, i.e. which stock had the biggest gain or dip. Going
further we can add a simulation tab which provides you with fake money and let's you invest as if it was real
and the fake portfolio changes with real time stock exchange prices.
